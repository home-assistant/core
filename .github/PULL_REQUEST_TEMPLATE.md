## Breaking change

  This project is very active and we have a high turnover of pull requests.

  Unfortunately, the number of incoming pull requests is higher than what our
  reviewers can review and merge so there is a long backlog of pull requests
  waiting for review. You can help here!
  
  By reviewing another pull request, you will help raise the code quality of
  that pull request and the final review will be faster. This way the general
  pace of pull request reviews will go up and your wait time will go down.
  
  When picking a pull request to review, try to choose one that hasn't yet
  been reviewed.

  Thanks for helping out!
