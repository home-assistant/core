      Stale docstring and test name: `test_form_home` and reusing result.
      Extract `async_setup_entry` into own fixture.
      Avoid importing `config_flow` in tests.

    comment: |
      The config flow misses data descriptions.
      Remove URLs from data descriptions, they should be replaced with placeholders.
      Make use of Electricity Maps zone keys in country code as dropdown.
      Make use of location selector for coordinates.

      Use `hass.config_entries.async_setup` instead of assert await `async_setup_component(hass, DOMAIN, {})`
      `test_sensor` could use `snapshot_platform`
