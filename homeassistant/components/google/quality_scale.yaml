      This depends on the legacy (deprecated) oauth libraries for device
      auth (no longer recommended auth). Google publishes to pypi using
      an internal build system. We need to either revisit approach or
      revisit our stance on this.

      The integration does not test the connection in `async_setup_entry` but
      instead does this in the calendar platform only, which can be improved.

      The config flow has 100% test coverage, however there are opportunities
      to increase functionality such as checking for the specific contents
      of a unique id assigned to a config entry.

      The integration stores config entry data in `hass.data` and should be
      updated to use `runtime_data`.

      The integration supports reauthentication, however the config flow test
      coverage can be improved on reauth corner cases.

      The main client `gcal_sync` library is async. The primary authentication
      used in config flow is handled by built in async OAuth code. The
      integration still supports legacy OAuth credentials setup in the
      configuration flow, which is no longer recommended or described in the
      documentation for new users. This legacy config flow uses oauth2client
      which is not natively async.
