      This depends on the legacy (deprecated) oauth libraries for device
      auth (no longer recommended auth). Google publishes to pypi using
      an internal build system. We need to either revisit approach or
      revisit our stance on this.

      Actions are current setup in `async_setup_entry` and need to be moved
      to `async_setup`.

      The integration does not test the connection in `async_setup_entry` but
      instead does this in the calendar platform only, which can be improved.

      The config flow has 100% test coverage, however there are opportunities
      to increase functionality such as checking for the specific contents
      of a unique id assigned to a config entry.

      The integration stores config entry data in `hass.data` and should be
      updated to use `runtime_data`.
