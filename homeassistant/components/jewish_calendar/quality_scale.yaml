    status: done
    comment: >-
      The multiple config entry was removed due to multiple bugs in the
      integration and low ROI.
      We might consider revisiting this as an additional feature in the future
      to allow supportong multiple languages for states, multiple locations and maybe
      use it as a solution for multiple Zmanim configurations.
