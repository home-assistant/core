    comment: When we refactor to use a coordinator, be sure to place it in coordinator.py.

    status: todo
    comment: Use mock calls to check test_urlize_plain_host instead of user_input mod checks, combine test_show_set_form with a happy path flow, finish test_connection_errors and test_login_error with CREATE_ENTRY to check error recovery, move test_success to top and assert unique id in it, split test_reauth to two so we can test incorrect password recovery.

    status: todo
    comment: Rename ConfigFlowHandler to HuaweiLteConfigFlow, see if we can catch more specific exceptions in get_device_info.

    comment: Kind of done, but to be reviewed, there's probably room for improvement. Maybe address this when converting to use a data update coordinator. See also https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/55495

    comment: Get percentage up there, add missing actual action press invocations in button tests' suspended state tests, rename test_switch.py to test_switch.py + make its functions receive hass as first parameter where applicable.

    comment: Prefer SSDP modelName over friendlyName, that tends to be better info and is more in line with what we get over the API as device name.

    comment: Most are trivially movable to translations, but some use numeric state ranges for selection (signal, bandwidth), and state selectors seem to apply only to enum like values.

  # Platinum
  async-dependency:
    status: todo
    comment: The integration is async, but underlying huawei-lte-api is not.
  inject-websession:
    status: todo
    comment: Underlying huawei-lte-api does not use aiohttp or httpx, so not sure if we can do anything about this.
  strict-typing:
    status: todo
    comment: Integration is strictly typechecked already, and huawei-lte-api and url-normalize are in order. stringcase is not typed.
