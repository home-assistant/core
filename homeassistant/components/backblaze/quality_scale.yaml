  # Platinum
  async-dependency:
    status: exempt
    comment: |
      The b2sdk library is synchronous by design. All sync operations are properly
      wrapped with async_add_executor_job to prevent blocking the event loop.
  inject-websession:
    status: exempt
    comment: |
      The b2sdk library does not support custom HTTP session injection.
      It manages HTTP connections internally through its own session management.
  strict-typing:
    status: exempt
    comment: |
      The b2sdk dependency does not include a py.typed file and is not PEP 561 compliant.
      This is outside the integration's control as it's a third-party library requirement.
