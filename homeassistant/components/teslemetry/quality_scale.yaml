      Multiline lambdas should be wrapped in parentheses for readability (e.g. streaming_listener).
      Use chained comparison: "if 1 < x < 100" instead of "if x > 1 and x < 100".

      async_unload_entry must clean up: (1) close TeslemetryStream websocket via
      stream.close(), (2) call remove_listener() for each vehicle to unsubscribe
      from stream events, (3) consider using entry.async_on_unload() during setup
      to register cleanup callbacks automatically.

      Discourage snapshot testing for state verification (e.g. test_binary_sensors_connectivity);
      use concrete assertions instead. Patch devices where they're used. Use entity_registry as
      test fixture. Clarify _alt and _noscope fixture purposes. Test error messages in
      test_service_validation_errors.

      Add model id to device info. VIN sensor may be redundant (already serial number in device).
      Version sensor should be sw_version in device info instead.

      New vehicles/energy sites added to user's Tesla account after initial setup
      are not detected. Need to periodically poll teslemetry.products() and add
      new TeslemetryVehicleData/TeslemetryEnergyData to runtime_data, then trigger
      entity creation via coordinator listeners in each platform.

      DRIVE_INVERTER_STATES has "unavailable" as a state value which conflicts with HA's
      unavailable state - shows duplicate in state trigger UI.

      ConfigEntryAuthFailed and UpdateFailed exceptions can have translated messages.
      Also one "unknown error" that cannot be translated.

      number.py:299 uses _attr_icon = icon_for_battery_level() instead of
      range-based icons in icons.json. Affects backup_reserve_percent and
      off_grid_vehicle_charging_reserve_percent entities. Remove the dynamic
      icon assignment and add range-based icon entries to icons.json.

      Reconfiguring has value even with OAuth - allows user to trigger reauth themselves
      (e.g. after logging out of all devices).
