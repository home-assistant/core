      async_unload_entry must clean up: (1) close TeslemetryStream websocket via
      stream.close(), (2) call remove_listener() for each vehicle to unsubscribe
      from stream events, (3) consider using entry.async_on_unload() during setup
      to register cleanup callbacks automatically.

      New vehicles/energy sites added to user's Tesla account after initial setup
      are not detected. Need to periodically poll teslemetry.products() and add
      new TeslemetryVehicleData/TeslemetryEnergyData to runtime_data, then trigger
      entity creation via coordinator listeners in each platform.

      number.py:299 uses _attr_icon = icon_for_battery_level() instead of
      range-based icons in icons.json. Affects backup_reserve_percent and
      off_grid_vehicle_charging_reserve_percent entities. Remove the dynamic
      icon assignment and add range-based icon entries to icons.json.
