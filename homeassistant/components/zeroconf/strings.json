This can cause network instability and excessive traffic.\n\nTo fix this issue:\n1. Change the instance ID on **only one** of the Home Assistant instances.\n2. Once the conflict is resolved, the repair issue on the other instance will disappear automatically.\n\nAfter confirming, a new instance ID will be generated for this Home Assistant instance and the instance will restart. This will not affect your configuration or data, but it may take a few minutes for other devices on your network to recognize the change.\n\nTo proceed, click 'Submit' below."
