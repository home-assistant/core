      The device currently polls every 30 seconds, which is a bit high when idle.
      We should consider dynamic polling intervals (e.g. when cleaning) and
      separate cloud vs local intervals.

      The documentation for `roborock.get_maps` should be updated so it is next
      to the other actions rather than only an example. All actions should be
      updated to use the simple table format.

      The docs talk about device communication works (cloud vs local), but does
      not yet describe data flow (e.g. polling). We should move into a separate
      section.

      There are good troubleshooting steps, however we should update the "cloud vs local"
      and rate limiting documentation with more information.

      The docs describe controlling the vacuum, though does not describe more
      interesting potential integrations with the homoe assistant ecosystem.

      The integration does not yet handle stale devices. The roborock app does
      support deleting devices and this is a gap #132590
