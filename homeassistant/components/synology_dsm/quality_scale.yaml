      `test_user` initializes flow with `None` data
      `test_user` imports a fixture that already patches, but then patches again
      `test_user` doesn't continue the old flow but creates a second one
      `test_user` can be parametrized to test the false SSL part
      `test_user_2sa` directly initialized the flow with form data
      Flows should end in CREATE_ENTRY or ABORT

      fixture could be autospecced and also be combined with the config flow one
      Consider creating a fixture of the mock config entry
