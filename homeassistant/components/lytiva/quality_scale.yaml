      This integration does not provide any service actions.
      It only creates light entities that use standard Home Assistant
      light services (turn_on, turn_off, brightness and color_temperature).

      This integration does not fetch data via polling HTTP APIs and is built
      around an MQTT-driven event model. A centralized DataUpdateCoordinator is
      not required for MQTT event callbacks that update entities directly.

      This integration does not provide any custom service actions.
      It only creates light entities that use standard Home Assistant
      light services which are already documented.
