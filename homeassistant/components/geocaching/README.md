# Geocaching Integration
## Overview
The Geocaching integration allows you to see some information related to your Geocaching profile, as well as to track both Trackables and Geocaches. For each Trackable and Geocache, a device with related entities is generated allowing you to extract the data. For example, you are able to display both Trackables and Geocaches on a map using the location entity.

The integration uses the [geocachingapi-python](https://github.com/Sholofly/geocachingapi-python) library, which in turn authenticates your Geocaching account using OAuth2 in order to send API requests to the [Geocaching API](https://api.groundspeak.com/documentation).

## Features
### Account information
After the integration has been configured, a device for your Geocaching account is generated, including entities to show statistics such as the total number of finds, hides and souvenirs.

### Tracked Geocaches
You have the option of configuring a number of tracked Geocaches. For each geocache, several entities are generated allowing you to see data about the cache, such as the number of favourite points, if you have found it, when it was hidden and its location.

### Tracked Trackables
You have the option of configuring a number of tracked Trackables. For each Trackable, several entities are generated allowing you to see data about the trackable, such as which cache it currently resides in, how far it has travelled and its location.

## Configuration
After adding the integration, you will be guided through the configuration process. The first step is authenticating your Geocaching account using OAuth2, in order to make API calls to the Geocaching API to gather all the necessary data. Then, you can optionally select Geocaches and Trackables to track.

## Displaying the information
As mentioned, the integration provides several entities that you can use to extract information from the Geocaching service. For your convenience, we provide a few preconfigured cards that you could use to display the information. Note, however, that you have to configure them as you will probably have different caches and trackables. For example, setting the reference code to one of the caches you are tracking in the tracked Geocache card.
