Only device-specific details (like model or manufacturer) are shared — never personally identifying information (like the names you assign).\n\nLearn more about the device database and how we process your data in our [Data Use Statement](https://www.openhomefoundation.org/device-database-data-use-statement), which you accept by opting in.",
