      For standalone cameras this does not apply: the integration should be removed.
      For cameras connected to a NVR/Hub: the entities of a device are marked unavailable when power is unplugged. They can be removed using async_remove_config_entry_device.
      Chimes can be uncoupled from the doorbell and removed from HA using async_remove_config_entry_device
      Automatic removal lead to many user issues when a device was temporarily out of wifi range or disconnected from power, so not implemented anymore.
