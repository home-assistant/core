# Architectural Decision Record (ADR) 003

# Context
The existing Shopping list integration previously handles items which has no assigned category as `null`. As part of this implementation and to have a meaningful category assignment for each item this was introduced. The changes involved should be minimal while ensuring alignment with the existing architecture.

# Decision Drivers
- Minimal Disruption to the existing Shopping list integration.
- Improved user experience and data consistency.
- Consistent with the current Home Assistant architecture

# Considered Options
- Replace null with a default category such as Other while keeping the other structure unchanged.

# Decision
The team decided that items with no category should not be assigned as `null`. Instead, it should be assigned to a category 'Other' as default. These change were only focused on the necessary components without introducing any major modifications.

# Consequences

# Positive
- Ensures consistent category values by improving data quality.
- Enhance user experience by avoiding non-categorized items.

# Negative
- No new structural enhancements were introduced.
- Already existing data stored as `null` require migration depending on the scenarios.
