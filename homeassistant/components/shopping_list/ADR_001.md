# Architectural Decision Record (ADR) 001

# Context
The  extension of the Shopping list integration was implemented within the context of the existing Home Assistant integration architecture. The already existing code had a good structure for handling, so the old codebase was extended without introducing any major structural changes. So the development of the functional requirements was focused to extend the current functionality and also to ensure future maintainability.

# Decision Drivers
- Maintainability and evolvable to future changes.
- Consistent with the existing Home Assistant Architecture.
- Minimum interruption to the existing Shopping List integration.

# Considered Options
- Try following the existing Shopping List integration structure and extend it only when required.

# Decision
The team decided to follow and extend the existing Shopping list integration without any major changes in the structure and also extend only the necessary components like adding new functions. This approach ensures no major architectural decisions and only ensures additions with the existing structure.

# Consequences

# Positive
- Reduces complexity as no new architectural patterns are involved.
- Allows future developers to easily understand and work with the existing code structure of the Shopping list integration.

# Negative
- Limited architectural changes and no new structural improvements was implemented in the Shopping list integration.
