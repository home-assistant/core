      Merge test_show_config_form with full flow test.
      Move full flow test to the top of all tests.
      All test cases should end in either CREATE_ENTRY or ABORT.

    status: done
    comment: |
      As there is no unique information available from the dependency mcstatus,
      the server address is used to identify that the same service is already configured.

      Although this is handled by the coordinator and no service actions are provided,

      Lookup API of the dependency mcstatus for Bedrock Edition servers is not async,
      but is non-blocking and therefore OK to be called. Refer to mcstatus FAQ
