            "description": "The Bayesian integration now also updates the probability if the observed `to_state`, `above`, `below`, or `value_template` evaluates to `False` rather than only `True`. So it is no longer required to have duplicate, complementary entries for each binary state. Please remove the mirrored entry for `{entity}` or else your calculated probabilities are likely to be incorrect.",
