SmartIR is a custom integration for controlling **climate devices**, **media palyers** and **fans** via infrared controllers.<br>
SmartIR currently supports the following controllers:
* [Broadlink](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/broadlink/)
* [Xiaomi IR Remote (ChuangmiIr)](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/remote.xiaomi_miio/)
* [LOOK.in Remote](http://look-in.club/devices/remote)
* [ESPHome User-defined service for remote transmitter](https://esphome.io/components/api.html#user-defined-services)
* [MQTT Publish service](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/service/)

More than 120 climate devices are currently supported out-of-the-box, mainly for the Broadlink controller, thanks to our awesome community.<br>
