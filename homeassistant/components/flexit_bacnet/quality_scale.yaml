    comment: >
      This is not possible with built-in discovery methods. Although the underlying
      library has a discovery method, this will be implemented in the future so
      that the config flow will initialize a discovery and make it easier for
      a user to add devices.

      The library is typed but it is unknown if it follows PEP-561.
