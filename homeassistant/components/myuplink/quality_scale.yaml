      Datapoint names are read from the API metadata and used as entity names in HA.
      It is not feasible to use the API names as translation keys as they can change between
      firmware and API upgrades and the number of appliance models and firmware releases are huge.
      Entity names translations are therefore not implemented for the time being.

      There is no way for the integration to know if a device is gone temporarily or permanently. User is allowed to delete a stale device from GUI.
