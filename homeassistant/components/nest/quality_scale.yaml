      The integration does a connection test in the configuration flow, however
      it does not fail if the user has ipv6 misconfigured.

      The integration does tests on setup, however the most common issues
      observed are related to ipv6 misconfigurations and the error messages
      are not self explanatory and can be improved.

      The integration has full test coverage however it does not yet assert the specific contents of the
      unique id of the created entry. Additional tests coverage for combinations of features like
      `test_dhcp_discovery_with_creds` would also be useful.
      Tests can be improved so that all end in either CREATE_ENTRY or ABORT.
