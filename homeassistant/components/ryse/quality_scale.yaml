    comment: |
      The integration only manages a simple BLE connection and does not maintain shared runtime state.
      Runtime data storage is unnecessary since all state is handled per device via BLE.

      It is possible for this device to be offline at setup time and still be functioning correctly. It can not be tested at setup.

    status: exempt
    comment: |
      Each BLE device is identified by its unique Bluetooth address,
      and duplicate configuration entries are naturally prevented by pairing logic.
