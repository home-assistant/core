      Full polling is performed at the configuration entry setup and
      device polling is performed when a CONNECTED or a PAIRED event is received.
      If many CONNECTED or PAIRED events are received for a device,
      the integration will stop polling for that device and will rise an issue.

      The Home Connect API does not allow to identify a user, so there is no
      way to know if multiple config entries are using the same account.
      Therefore, the integration does only allow one config entry.
