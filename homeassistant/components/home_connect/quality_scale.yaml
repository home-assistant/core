      Full polling is performed at the configuration entry setup and
      device polling is performed when a CONNECTED or a PAIRED event is received.
      If many CONNECTED or PAIRED events are received for a device within a short time span,
      the integration will stop polling for that device and will create a repair issue.

      This integration doesn't have settings in its configuration flow.
