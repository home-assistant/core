      Actions are per device and not per integration.
      ESPHome supports user defined actions which come
      from the device YAML configuration.

      ESPHome uses sleepy devices and fast reconnect logic
      so we cannot raise ConfigEntryNotReady as we need to use
      the reconnect logic in aioesphomeapi to know when to trigger
      connections.
