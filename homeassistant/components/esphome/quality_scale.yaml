      Since actions are defined per device, rather than per integration,
      they are specific to the device's YAML configuration. Additionally,
      ESPHome allows for user-defined actions, making it impossible to
      set them up until the device is connected as they vary by device. For more
      information, see: https://esphome.io/components/api.html#user-defined-actions

      ESPHome relies on sleepy devices and fast reconnect logic, so we
      can't raise `ConfigEntryNotReady`. Instead, we need to utilize the
      reconnect logic in `aioesphomeapi` to determine the right moment
      to trigger the connection.

      Since ESPHome is a framework for creating custom devices, the
      possibilities are virtually limitless. As a result, example
      automations would likely only be relevant to the specific user
      of the device and not generally useful to others.
