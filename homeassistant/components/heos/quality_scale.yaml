      1. The config flow is 100% covered, however some tests need to let HA create the flow
      handler instead of doing it manually in the test.
      2. We should also make sure every test ends in either CREATE_ENTRY or ABORT so we test
      that the flow is able to recover from an error.

      1. YAML import to be removed after core team meeting discussion on approach.
      2. Consider enhnacement to automatically select a host when multiple are discovered.
      3. Move hass.data[heos_discovered_hosts] into hass.data[heos]

      Simplify by using async_on_remove instead of keeping track of listeners to remove
      later in async_will_remove_from_hass.

      The HEOS integration only supports a single config entry, but needs to be migrated to use
      the `single_config_entry` flag. HEOS devices interconnect to each other, so connecting to
      a single node yields access to all the devices setup with HEOS on your network. The HEOS API
      documentation does not recommend connecting to multiple nodes which would provide no bennefit.

      1. Integration has >95% coverage, however tests need to be updated to not patch internals.
      2. test_async_setup_entry_connect_failure and test_async_setup_entry_player_failure -> Instead of
         calling async_setup_entry directly, rather use hass.config_entries.async_setup and then assert
         the config_entry.state is what we expect.
      3. test_unload_entry -> We should use hass.config_entries.async_unload and assert the entry state
      4. Recommend using snapshot in test_state_attributes.
      5. Find a way to avoid using internal dispatcher in test_updates_from_connection_event.

      The integraiton creates devices, but needs to stringify the id for the device identifier and
      also migrate the device.
