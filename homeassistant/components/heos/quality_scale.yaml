      1. Integration has >95% coverage, however tests need to be updated to not patch internals.
      2. test_async_setup_entry_connect_failure and test_async_setup_entry_player_failure -> Instead of
         calling async_setup_entry directly, rather use hass.config_entries.async_setup and then assert
         the config_entry.state is what we expect.
      3. test_unload_entry -> We should use hass.config_entries.async_unload and assert the entry state
      4. Recommend using snapshot in test_state_attributes.
      5. Find a way to avoid using internal dispatcher in test_updates_from_connection_event.

      The integraiton creates devices, but needs to stringify the id for the device identifier and
      also migrate the device.
