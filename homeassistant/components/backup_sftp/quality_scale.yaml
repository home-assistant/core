    comment: |
      This backup storage integration uses static SFTP credentials that do not expire
      or require token refresh. Authentication failures indicate configuration issues
      that should be resolved by reconfiguring the integration.

  reconfiguration-flow:
    status: exempt
    comment: |
      This backup storage integration's configuration consists of static SFTP
      connection parameters (host, port, credentials, backup path). Changes to
      these parameters effectively create a connection to a different backup
      location, which should be configured as a separate integration instance.
  repair-issues:
    status: exempt
    comment: |
      This integration provides backup storage functionality only. Connection
      failures are handled through config entry setup errors and do not require
      persistent repair issues. Users can resolve authentication or connectivity
      problems by reconfiguring the integration through the config flow.
