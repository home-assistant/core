"""Sandbox runtime — the long-running process inside one sandbox group.

Composes the sandbox's per-process services:

* :class:`FlowRunner` — drives integration ``ConfigFlow`` instances
  out-of-process.
* :class:`EntryRunner` — accepts ``sandbox/entry_setup`` pushes and
  runs ``async_setup_entry`` against the sandbox-private HA.
* :class:`EntityBridge` — pushes entity registrations + state changes
  back to main.
* :class:`ServiceMirror` / :class:`EventMirror` — mirror service
  registrations and ``<owned_domain>_*`` events up to main, gated by
  :class:`ApprovedDomains`.

The handshake: open the control channel (transport selected by the
``--url`` scheme — ``stdio://`` by default, ``unix://<path>`` to dial back
to the manager's unix socket), send a :data:`MSG_READY` frame as the first
message, warm-load restore state, register handlers, then idle until
SIGTERM (or until main asks for a graceful shutdown over the channel — see
:meth:`SandboxRuntime._handle_shutdown`).
