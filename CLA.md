# 1. Grant of Copyright License.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement, You grant to the Projects’ maintainers, contributors,
users and to Home Assistant a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce,
prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your contributions and such
derivative works. Except for this license, You reserve all rights, title, and interest in your contributions.

license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer your contributions, where such license
applies only to those patent claims licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by your contribution or by combination of
your contribution with the project to which this contribution was submitted.

If any entity institutes patent litigation - including cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit - against You alleging that
your contribution or any project it was submitted to constitutes or is responsible for direct or contributory patent infringement,
then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

Your contribution is either your original creation, based upon previous work that, to the best of your knowledge,
is covered under an appropriate open source license and you have the right under that license to submit that work with modifications,
whether created in whole or in part by you, or you have clearly identified the source of the contribution and any license or other
restriction (like related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are personally aware.
