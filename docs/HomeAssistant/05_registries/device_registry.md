title: Device registry
---

The device registry is a registry where Home Assistant keeps track of devices. A device is represented in Home Assistant via one or more entities. For example, a battery-powered temperature and humidity sensor might expose entities for temperature, humidity and battery level.

## What is a device?

A device in Home Assistant represents either a physical device that has its own control unit, or a service. The control unit itself does not have to be smart, but it should be in control of what happens. For example, an Ecobee thermostat with 4 room sensors equals 5 devices in Home Assistant, one for the thermostat including all sensors inside it, and one for each room sensor.

If you connect a sensor to another device to read some of its data, it should still be represented as two different devices. The reason for this is that the sensor could be moved to read the data of another device.

A device that offers multiple endpoints, may be split into separate devices and refer back to a parent device with the `via_device` attribute. This allows the separate endpoints to be assigned to different areas in the building and it also allows logical grouping of entities. Typical examples of when a device should be split in a parent device and multiple child devices are smart power strips or smart multi-gang wall switches. The parent device will have entities representing the state of the power strip or multi-gang switch, for example network connection status and firmware update. The sub devices will group entities tied to one of the channels, for example a switch entity and energy consumption sensor per channel.

## Defining devices

### Automatic registration through an entity
:::tip
Entity device info is only read if the entity is loaded via a [config entry](config_entries_index.md) and the `unique_id` property is defined.
:::

Each entity is able to define a device via the `device_info` property. This property is read when an entity is added to Home Assistant via a config entry. A device will be matched up with an existing device via supplied identifiers or connections, like serial numbers or MAC addresses. If identifiers and connections are provided, the device registry will first try to match by identifiers. Each identifier and each connection is matched individually (e.g. only one connection needs to match to be considered the same device).

```python
# Definition of DeviceInfo TypedDict
class DeviceInfo(TypedDict, total=False):
    """Entity device information for device registry."""

    configuration_url: str | URL | None
    connections: set[tuple[str, str]]
    created_at: str
    default_manufacturer: str
    default_model: str
    default_name: str
    entry_type: DeviceEntryType | None
    identifiers: set[tuple[str, str]]
    manufacturer: str | None
    model: str | None
    model_id: str | None
    modified_at: str
    name: str | None
    serial_number: str | None
    suggested_area: str | None
    sw_version: str | None
    hw_version: str | None
    translation_key: str | None
    translation_placeholders: Mapping[str, str] | None
    via_device: tuple[str, str]

# Inside a platform
class HueLight(LightEntity):
    @property
    def device_info(self) -> DeviceInfo:
        """Return the device info."""
        return DeviceInfo(
            identifiers={
                # Serial numbers are unique identifiers within a specific domain
                (hue.DOMAIN, self.unique_id)
            },
            name=self.name,
            manufacturer=self.light.manufacturername,
            model=self.light.productname,
            model_id=self.light.modelid,
            sw_version=self.light.swversion,
            via_device=(hue.DOMAIN, self.api.bridgeid),
        )
```

Besides device properties, `device_info` can also include `default_manufacturer`, `default_model`, `default_name`. These values will be added to the device registry if no other value is defined just yet. This can be used by integrations that know some information but not very specific. For example, a router that identifies devices based on MAC addresses.

### Manual registration

Components are also able to register devices in the case that there are no entities representing them. An example is a hub that communicates with the lights.

```python
# Definition of DeviceRegistry.async_get_or_create:
class DeviceRegistry(BaseRegistry[dict[str, list[dict[str, Any]]]]):
    ...

    @callback
    def async_get_or_create(
        self,
        *,
        config_entry_id: str,
        config_subentry_id: str | None | UndefinedType = UNDEFINED,
        configuration_url: str | URL | None | UndefinedType = UNDEFINED,
        connections: set[tuple[str, str]] | None | UndefinedType = UNDEFINED,
        created_at: str | datetime | UndefinedType = UNDEFINED,  # will be ignored
        default_manufacturer: str | None | UndefinedType = UNDEFINED,
        default_model: str | None | UndefinedType = UNDEFINED,
        default_name: str | None | UndefinedType = UNDEFINED,
        # To disable a device if it gets created
        disabled_by: DeviceEntryDisabler | None | UndefinedType = UNDEFINED,
        entry_type: DeviceEntryType | None | UndefinedType = UNDEFINED,
        hw_version: str | None | UndefinedType = UNDEFINED,
        identifiers: set[tuple[str, str]] | None | UndefinedType = UNDEFINED,
        manufacturer: str | None | UndefinedType = UNDEFINED,
        model: str | None | UndefinedType = UNDEFINED,
        model_id: str | None | UndefinedType = UNDEFINED,
        modified_at: str | datetime | UndefinedType = UNDEFINED,  # will be ignored
        name: str | None | UndefinedType = UNDEFINED,
        serial_number: str | None | UndefinedType = UNDEFINED,
        suggested_area: str | None | UndefinedType = UNDEFINED,
        sw_version: str | None | UndefinedType = UNDEFINED,
        translation_key: str | None = None,
        translation_placeholders: Mapping[str, str] | None = None,
        via_device: tuple[str, str] | None | UndefinedType = UNDEFINED,
    ) -> DeviceEntry:
        ...

# Inside a component
from homeassistant.helpers import device_registry as dr

device_registry = dr.async_get(hass)

device_registry.async_get_or_create(
    config_entry_id=entry.entry_id,
    connections={(dr.CONNECTION_NETWORK_MAC, config.mac)},
    identifiers={(DOMAIN, config.bridgeid)},
    manufacturer="Signify",
    suggested_area="Kitchen",
    name=config.name,
    model=config.modelname,
    model_id=config.modelid,
    sw_version=config.swversion,
    hw_version=config.hwversion,
)
```

## Removing devices

Integrations can opt in to allow the user to delete a device from the UI. To do this, integrations should implement the function `async_remove_config_entry_device` in their `__init__.py` module.

```py
async def async_remove_config_entry_device(
    hass: HomeAssistant, config_entry: ConfigEntry, device_entry: DeviceEntry
) -> bool:
    """Remove a config entry from a device."""
```

When the user clicks the delete device button for the device and confirms it, `async_remove_config_entry_device` will be awaited and if `True` is returned, the config entry will be removed from the device. If it was the only config entry of the device, the device will be removed from the device registry.

In `async_remove_config_entry_device` the integration should take the necessary steps to prepare for device removal and return `True` if successful. The integration may optionally act on `EVENT_DEVICE_REGISTRY_UPDATED` if that's more convenient than doing the cleanup in `async_remove_config_entry_device`.

## Categorizing to device info

Device info is categorized into Link, Primary and Secondary by finding the first device info type which has all the keys of the device info.

| Category             | Keys                 |
| -------------------- | ---------------------|
| Link                 | `connections` and `identifiers` |
| Primary              | `configuration_url`, `connections`, `entry_type`, `hw_version`, `identifiers`, `manufacturer`, `model`, `name`, `suggested_area`, `sw_version`, and `via_device`|
| Secondary            | `connections`, `default_manufacturer`, `default_model`, `default_name`, and `via_device`|

This categorization is used in sorting the configuration entries to define the main integration to be used by the frontend.

Mandatorily, the device info must match one of the categories.
