# Using a local "system" mypy instead of the mypy hook, because its
# results depend on what is installed. And the mypy hook runs in a
# virtualenv of its own, meaning we'd need to install and maintain
# another set of our dependencies there... no. Use the "system" one
# and reuse the environment that is set up anyway already instead.
