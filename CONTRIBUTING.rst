Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `locationsharinglib` for local development.

1. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone https://github.com/costastf/locationsharinglib

2. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your clone for local development::

    $ mkvirtualenv locationsharinglib
    $ cd locationsharinglib/
    $ python setup.py develop

3. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

4. Commit your changes and push your branch to the server::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

5. Submit a merge request
