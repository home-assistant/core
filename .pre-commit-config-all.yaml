# This configuration includes the full set of hooks we use. In
# addition to the defaults (see .pre-commit-config.yaml), this
# includes hooks that require our development and test dependencies
# installed and the virtualenv containing them active by the time
# pre-commit runs to produce correct results.
#
# If this is not a problem for your workflow, using this config is
# recommended, install it with
#     pre-commit install --config .pre-commit-config-all.yaml
# Otherwise, see the default .pre-commit-config.yaml for a lighter one.

# results depend on what is installed. And the mypy hook runs in a
# virtualenv of its own, meaning we'd need to install and maintain
# another set of our dependencies there... no. Use the "system" one
# and reuse the environment that is set up anyway already instead.
